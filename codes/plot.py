Hello! How can I assist you today with your data science tasks? If you need help with data analysis, visualization, or modeling using Python, feel free to ask. Here are a few examples of what I can do:

- Load and explore data using pandas.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Create visualizations with matplotlib, seaborn, or other libraries.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models using sklearn.
- Provide code snippets for specific tasks or problems.

What would you like to work on?

For example, you can ask me to generate code for loading a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame like this:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data from a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(data.head())
```
